<p>
Hi, I'm Jordi Villar. I am from <strong>Barcelona</strong>, Spain.
</p>

<p>
I'm an <strong>engineer</strong> with more than 10 years of experience. During these years I acquired a vast knowledge in several areas and technologies.
</p>

<p>
For the last 3 years, I have been leading the <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>machine learning team</strong> in an ad-tech company.
</p>

<p>
In this role, I am working side by side with a team of engineers on machine learning and <strong>big data</strong> areas. With this team, I developed <strong>algorithms</strong> that drive automated pricing and high-frequency bidding on real-time auctions, able to run at scale. I also designed the reporting infrastructure, to enable ongoing performance analysis, as well as provide post-campaign insights.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining this role, I have worked in machine learning, and <strong>computer vision</strong> related areas focused on researching and developing. I have been working in big companies and startups, which allowed me to gain experience in multidisciplinary areas.
</p>

<p>
I hold a <strong>Telecommunications Engineering</strong> degree (roughly equivalent to an ECE, master included) from the UPC in Barcelona.</p>
